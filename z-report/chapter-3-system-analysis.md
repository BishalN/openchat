```

#### Dynamic Modeling

**State Diagram for Agent Training**

The agent training process follows a state machine pattern:

1. **Initial State**: Agent created but not trained
2. **Processing State**: Training in progress with sources
3. **Trained State**: Agent ready for chat interactions

**State Diagram**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created : User creates agent
    Created --> Configuring : User configures agent
    Configuring --> Created : Cancel configuration
    Configuring --> ReadyForTraining : Save configuration
    ReadyForTraining --> Training : Start training process
    Training --> Training : Process sources
    Training --> Trained : Training completed
    Training --> Failed : Training error
    Failed --> ReadyForTraining : Retry training
    Trained --> Active : Agent deployed
    Active --> Inactive : Agent disabled
    Inactive --> Active : Agent enabled
    Active --> [*] : Agent deleted
```

**Sequence Diagram for Chat Interaction**

The chat interaction flow involves multiple system components:

1. User sends message to chat interface
2. Frontend validates and formats message
3. Message sent to tRPC API endpoint
4. Backend processes message through AI service
5. Response generated and returned to frontend
6. Message displayed in chat interface
7. Conversation history updated in database

**Sequence Diagram**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as Chat Interface
    participant API as tRPC API
    participant AI as Gemini AI
    participant DB as Database
    
    U->>UI: Send message
    UI->>UI: Validate message
    UI->>API: POST /api/chat
    API->>DB: Get conversation history
    DB-->>API: Return history
    API->>AI: Process with context
    AI-->>API: Generate response
    API->>DB: Save message and response
    DB-->>API: Confirm save
    API-->>UI: Return response
    UI->>UI: Display response
    UI-->>U: Show message in chat
```

**Activity Diagram for Agent Creation**

The agent creation process involves several parallel activities:

1. User initiates agent creation
2. System validates user permissions
3. Agent configuration saved to database
4. Knowledge sources processed in parallel
5. Agent training initiated
6. Training progress monitored
7. Agent becomes available for use

**Activity Diagram**

```mermaid

    A[User initiates agent creation] --> B{Validate user permissions}
    B -->|Valid| C[Create agent configuration]
    B -->|Invalid| D[Show error message]

1. **User Authentication Flow**
   - Input: Google OAuth credentials
   - Process: Supabase authentication

2. **File Processing Flow**
   - Input: Uploaded files
   - Process: Text extraction and chunking
   - Output: Processed knowledge base

3. **Chat Processing Flow**
   - Input: User message
   - Process: AI model processing with context
   - Output: Generated response

This comprehensive system analysis provides the foundation for the detailed design phase, ensuring that all requirements are properly understood and the system architecture is well-defined before implementation begins.
